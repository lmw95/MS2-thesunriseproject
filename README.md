# The Sunrise Project - A Visitors Guide
> This project is for purely educational purposes only. Content and information within this project may not be 100% accurate and is based on a fictitious tourism board.

With the event of COVID-19 resulting in the dramatic increase in staycations, The Sunrise Project (a small collective of local buisiness owners) came together to promote the area of the Suffolk coast known locally as the 'Sunrise Coast', the most easterly coastline in the country, not only to visitors from outside the area, but to local people who may not know what lies right on their doorstep.

This website is the company's primary marketing method, and offers a fun and welcoming online information center for the Sunrise Coast, complete with an interactive guide to help visitors make the most of their trip. The company focuses on day trips, but working with local partners and businesses, promotes local hospitality, accommodation and much more.
