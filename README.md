# The Sunrise Project - A Visitors Guide
> This project is for purely educational purposes only. Content and information within this project may not be 100% accurate and is based on a fictitious tourism board.

With the event of COVID-19 resulting in the dramatic increase in staycations, The Sunrise Project (a small collective of local buisiness owners) came together to promote the area of the Suffolk coast known locally as the 'Sunrise Coast', the most easterly coastline in the country, not only to visitors from outside the area, but to local people who may not know what lies right on their doorstep.

This website is the company's primary marketing method, and offers an online information center for the Sunrise Coast, complete with an interactive guide to help visitors make the most of their day out. As the area advertised is not well-known outside of Suffolk, this means that the website will serve as an introduction as well as a guide to the local area.

## ii. Strategy
### Project inception
I was inspired to create this website due to the rise in staycations around the UK following the COVID-19 travel restrictions from 2020 - 2021, and possibly beyond. My hometown sits on a strip of coastline called the 'Sunrise Coast', and has historically been a tourism spot since the Victorian times (since the town was connected to London by railway).

I thought that a guide to the Sunrise Coast would be an ideal project to work on for two main reasons:
1) The area needs revenue from tourism more than ever, due to the economic and social decline the area has experienced in the last 20-30 years, and the rise in staycations could be a perfect time to encourage visitors to the area
2) It would help and uplift local people by pointing out little corners of the area that they might be unaware of, or haven't had the chance to visit yet, and also raise awareness of local businesses and organisations who rely on local (and external visitor) spending

### Research
To find my own inspiration for the site, I looked at other tourism board's websites for ideas, whilst taking into consideration time restraints and my own JavaScript/jQuery abilities. I was looking out for interactive elements of the websites that I could apply to my own fictional tourism board, and I found myself drawing the most inspiration from [Visit Devon](https://www.visitdevon.co.uk/), [Visit England](https://www.visitengland.com/) and [Discover Lowestoft](https://www.discoverlowestoft.co.uk/).

## iii. Scope
### Target audience
The target users of this website are both local people and external visitors who wish to look for some inspiration for their visit to the Sunrise Coast, and as the area is not well-known outside of the county of Suffolk, this means that the website serves as an introduction and a guide to the local area.

### Scope table of interactive features
To ensure I was including the most important interactive features/information that potential visitors would need, I planned out exactly what the scope for this website would be:

* A simple guide for those looking for a day out in the Sunrise Coast

Now that I had a scope, I could focus and define exactly what I would need for the upcoming project. I began to plan and asked various friends and family what they believed should be included on a local tourism board's website. The interactive guide was the component that interested users the most, as it engaged with potential visitors and suggested helpful information for those visiting the area for the first time. Below is all of the suggestions I accumulated which helped me to decide what to include:

Potential feature | Importance | Viability | Overall score
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
*INTERACTIVE GUIDE*
Clickable activity options | 5 | 5 | 10
Reset button for guide | 5 | 5 | 10

Toggle for visitor age range | 3 | 2 | 5

Toggle for specific location | 2 | 2 | 4
*LOCATION PAGE*

Clickable Google Maps markers that trigger accordians | 1 | 1 | 2
*VISITOR CENTER*

*CONTACT MODAL* 
Submissable enquiry to owner | 5 | 5 | 10

### Final interactive features
I narrowed down the scope to the final interactive features which would be included alongside the HTML/CSS features:

*INTERACTIVE GUIDE*
* Clickable activity buttons
* Reset button
* 'Show all' locations button
* Blur effect on unselected activities
